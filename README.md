# 📖 Project Overview
# Mall Customer Segmentation
Mall Customer Segmentation is a Machine Learning project that groups customers into different categories based on their demographic information and purchasing behavior. The project uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm to identify meaningful customer segments that can help businesses improve marketing strategies, customer engagement, and decision-making.

The system provides a web-based interface where users can input customer details and predict the customer segment. It also includes a dashboard for visualizing customer insights and cluster statistics.

# 🎯 Project Scope
The project focuses on:

* Customer data analysis.
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
* Customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering.
* Customer segment prediction through a web application.
* Dashboard visualization of customer statistics.
* Business intelligence through cluster analysis.

Future enhancements may include:

* Real-time customer analytics.
* Recommendation systems.
* Advanced clustering algorithms.
* Interactive business reports.
